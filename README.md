# Capstone-Project
# BOLT IOT Certification Project 
This Project is based on the BOLT IOT device used to monitor the temperature in the frezzer in the refrigerator.
The Project Requirements :
  *) Bolt IOT device 
  *) Bread Board 
  *) connecting Wires
  *) Temperature Sensor LM35
  *) Telegram Software
  *) LED
  *) Power Supply
  *) Internet Connectivity
This project Monitor the temperature in the refridgrator continuously and predict the upcoming temperature by using Z-score Analysis and Prediction algoritham
This measure the temperature plot the temperature in the prediction Graph.
If any Anomaly is detected in the refridgerator the IOT device will send the warning message to the USER or Admin
And Periodically The Device will send the current temperature to the USER or Admin
